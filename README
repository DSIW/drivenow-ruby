	car = cars.first

= Known Bugs
	Sometimes cars are in the city of Unterhaching, Oberding or Korschenbroich, so near another "official" city. 
	These are not included in the current "master-city" yet.

= Known problems
	There are still some problems with encoding in Ruby 1.8.7.
        With Ruby 1.9 you can just use "öäü".encode("UTF-8") and you're good.
